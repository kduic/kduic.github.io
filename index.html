            <li>Grate the apple</li>
            <li>Proof the <u>yeast</u> by dissolving it in 1 teaspoon sugar and 1 cup of warm water <b>(not over 110 F)</b>. When it foams, pour into a large bowl and add the flour, salt, raisins, walnuts, grated apple, and zest. Mix well. Add 3 to 4 cups water, or as much as necessary to achieve a cake batter consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the batter rise until <u>doubled</u>, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan or Dutch oven, heat oil to <i>370 F</i>. Carefully drop tablespoons of batter into the oil, being careful not to overcrowd. Fry until golden on the bottom. Turn over once to brown both sides.</li>
            <li>Remove the fritules with a slotted spoon onto layers of paper towels to drain. Repeat until batter is finished. Sprinkle fritule with confectioners' sugar while still hot, if desired.</li>
